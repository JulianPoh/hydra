Kill the Hydra!

Hydra heads will appear and start changing color.

Click on the heads when they are blue to cut them off.

Once a head has changed color, you will have to get it back to blue by clicking to change it back to its previous color before you can cut it off.              
Once a head reaches red, it will spew fire and end the game.

Oh and... once you cut off a Hydra's head, another two will grow in its place. Good Luck!

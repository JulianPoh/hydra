                <li>Click on the heads when they are blue to cut them off.</li>
                <li>Once a head has changed color, you will have to get it back to blue by clicking to change it back to its previous color before you can cut it off.</li>
                <li>Once a head reaches red, it will spew fire and end the game.</li>
                <li>Oh and... once you cut off a Hydra's head, another two will grow in its place. Good Luck!</li>
